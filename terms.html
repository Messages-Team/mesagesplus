    downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you
    read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our
    trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t
    try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
    copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Messages Plus.</p>
<p>Messages Plus is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
    reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
    never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
<p>The Messages Plus stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your
    responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
    root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
    operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
    compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Messages Plus won’t work properly or at
    all.</p>
<div><p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app</p>

<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Messages Plus will not take responsibility for. Certain
    functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
    provided by your mobile network provider, but Messages Plus cannot take responsibility for the app not working at
    full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of
    data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app,
    you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of
    your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
    device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
    payer for using the app.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Messages Plus cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
    make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
    Messages Plus cannot accept responsibility.</p>
<p>With respect to Messages Plus’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
    bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third
    parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Messages Plus accepts no liability for
    any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the
    system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll
    need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Messages Plus does not promise that it will always
    update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your
    device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
    stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless
    we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
    you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for
    any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
<p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-05-11</p>
